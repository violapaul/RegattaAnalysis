crew:

purpose: tune_up
conditions: Beautiful day. Winds were 3 quickly building to 10ish. Flat seas. Upwind
  to Pt. Wells buoy, raised and raced home to the hamburger.
performance: Good height and speed vs. Creative on the way upwind. Perhaps a bit slow
  at first downwind, exploring to tradeoffs between depth and speed.  Best downwind
  speed when I was at the shrouds and Sara had a hand on the mainsheet.
learnings: 'Let the sails out for downwind: both main and kite.  Stand forward if
  possible.

  Shroud settings seemed really great, and versatile.  With only 2 on the boat, we
  sailed very well.  These settings are the new base!'

    a bit off the middle (12 down to 10).

description: ''
crew:
- Paul
- Sara
purpose: tune_up
conditions: Beautiful day. Very light at times, almost glassy.
performance: 'We were expecting a super light day, and it did not disappoint. Often
  below the 3 knots, though most of the time we had enough wind to move.

  Good height and speed vs. Creative.  Generally Creative sails lower and faster,
  and it can be super hard to know who is winning.

  We sailed both with "full depth" sails (no backstay, high traveler, little outhaul,
  light halyards) and with "flat sails" (4 inches of backstay, outhaul, tighter halyards).  I
  am not sure there was a clear winner from looking at the video.  We sailed higher
  on flat sails, without much speed penalty.  The height is very clear near the end
  of the video.

  I do know there was a point when we were flat where we encountered some smallish
  waves from a powerboat...  we seemed to stop in our tracks.  And if the wind were
  to come up (to 6 or 8), "full sails" would be right.

  The only recent race where I would consider "flat" would be Foulweather Bluff.  Hours
  of flat and glassy with less than 3 knots of wind.  It took us a while to get in
  the groove on flat...  so a very long leg would be needed.'
learnings: Based on Al's advice, we got a bit more speed and height by lowering traveller
  a bit and sheeting on more.

purpose: tune_up
conditions: 'Super light winds from the SSE (1-3) during tuneup.  Gave up a bit early.  After,
  on the way back, winds picked up to 8-10.

  There should have been a strong current heading south, due to a large flood.  The
  interactions between southerly current and winds from the south may have been complex.'
performance: We tried flat sails again vs. Creative and did not do well. Initially
  it seemed OK, but then they just pulled away (perhaps as we encountered wake from
  passing barge.)

  thoughts: 'Leward upper was lose at times, with about a 1 inch circle. Leward middle
    was snug.  The top fell off to leward when pressure was high.  Even with 4-5 backstay,
    there was still noticable sag in the headstay.

    Perhaps we could have gone a bit tigher overall.  Tighter up to control fall off.  Tighter
    middles/lower to transfer more tension to headstay.  But it is not clear if that
    would be faster.  The boat did not show excessive heel or weather helm.'

performance: Once again, sailed higher (faster?) on stbd than port.
observations: 'Way better!  We handled every transition without a major mistake. Need
  to get better at rounding upwind and trimming to accelerate. Don''t be a afraid
  to reach a bit to keep up speed.  Proposal: set the wheel to a gradual upwind turn,
  and then keep pulling in mainsheet to keep up.  Alternative reach more and wait
  for the spin stuff to be done.'
warnings: We adjusted the AWA offset from -4 degrees back to 0.0 (Tutmark adjusted
  it, seemed OK at the time, and it just does not seem right anymore.  Perhaps after
  we re-set the mast things went back?

  thoughts: I believe these are Sara's new base settings.  Did not get up to look
    at the mast.  Conditions were higher than expected, so there is a chance these
    were too loose.  We went pretty well, but were not out long enough to make any

description: "Solid day of racing against \u201CMore Uff Da\u201D and \u201CJaded\u201D.

  need to calculate the handicap. "

  East so we raised spin at start on a port tack to Ballard buoy and stayed on spin

  not have to go to the mark. The U mark was new to many of us. '

description: Creative Jubaliee and us made for a good race
learnings: 'Main sheet got tangled on the binacle so rounding at Meadow Point was
  messed up.  I over focused on untangling and accidentally jibed.  Then had to jibe
  back quick to the starboard tack with More Ufda right behind.  Later Paul accused
  me of almost killing him.  That was later retracted but I was initially very anxious
  that it was closer than I realized.  He exaggeratied the danger that he was watching
  for and ducked.   He was skipper and flipped driver and bow several times when he
  felt he could do a better job in my position than I was.  I left not wanting to
  return.  Some discussion ensued over video replay. '

  100% attention 100% of the time.\n\n\nWe focused intensely on Moose, a luxury since
  there were no other boats nearby (Rush was ahead the whole time!).  We marked them
  and beat them to U mark, and then separated 20+ boat lengths.  Congrats.\n\n\nTacks
  were great. Jibes were flawless.  Raise was great.  Douse worked well.  Folks did
  their jobs, with little practice and little review.  And no critical job got dropped.
  \ Props to Amy for working the PIT, which has dozens of little steps (in addition
  to main\u2026 and we were pretty fast).\n\n\nThanks to you both for showing up early
  and for keeping cheerful through the near constant rain.  Almost July 4th and it
  was darn cold out there!  (Double thanks for Steve for getting there first and getting
  the boat almost completely set!)\n\n"
