crew:

purpose: tune_up
conditions: Beautiful day. Winds were 3 quickly building to 10ish. Flat seas. Upwind
  to Pt. Wells buoy, raised and raced home to the hamburger.
performance: Good height and speed vs. Creative on the way upwind. Perhaps a bit slow
  at first downwind, exploring to tradeoffs between depth and speed.  Best downwind
  speed when I was at the shrouds and Sara had a hand on the mainsheet.
learnings: 'Let the sails out for downwind: both main and kite.  Stand forward if
  possible.

  Shroud settings seemed really great, and versatile.  With only 2 on the boat, we
  sailed very well.  These settings are the new base!'

    a bit off the middle (12 down to 10).

description: ''
crew:
- Paul
- Sara
purpose: tune_up
conditions: Beautiful day. Very light at times, almost glassy.
performance: 'We were expecting a super light day, and it did not disappoint. Often
  below the 3 knots, though most of the time we had enough wind to move.

  Good height and speed vs. Creative.  Generally Creative sails lower and faster,
  and it can be super hard to know who is winning.

  We sailed both with "full depth" sails (no backstay, high traveler, little outhaul,
  light halyards) and with "flat sails" (4 inches of backstay, outhaul, tighter halyards).  I
  am not sure there was a clear winner from looking at the video.  We sailed higher
  on flat sails, without much speed penalty.  The height is very clear near the end
  of the video.

  I do know there was a point when we were flat where we encountered some smallish
  waves from a powerboat...  we seemed to stop in our tracks.  And if the wind were
  to come up (to 6 or 8), "full sails" would be right.

  The only recent race where I would consider "flat" would be Foulweather Bluff.  Hours
  of flat and glassy with less than 3 knots of wind.  It took us a while to get in
  the groove on flat...  so a very long leg would be needed.'
learnings: Based on Al's advice, we got a bit more speed and height by lowering traveller
  a bit and sheeting on more.

purpose: tune_up
conditions: 'Super light winds from the SSE (1-3) during tuneup.  Gave up a bit early.  After,
  on the way back, winds picked up to 8-10.

  There should have been a strong current heading south, due to a large flood.  The
  interactions between southerly current and winds from the south may have been complex.'
performance: We tried flat sails again vs. Creative and did not do well. Initially
  it seemed OK, but then they just pulled away (perhaps as we encountered wake from
  passing barge.)

  thoughts: 'Leward upper was lose at times, with about a 1 inch circle. Leward middle
    was snug.  The top fell off to leward when pressure was high.  Even with 4-5 backstay,
    there was still noticable sag in the headstay.

    Perhaps we could have gone a bit tigher overall.  Tighter up to control fall off.  Tighter
    middles/lower to transfer more tension to headstay.  But it is not clear if that
    would be faster.  The boat did not show excessive heel or weather helm.'

performance: Once again, sailed higher (faster?) on stbd than port.
observations: 'Way better!  We handled every transition without a major mistake. Need
  to get better at rounding upwind and trimming to accelerate. Don''t be a afraid
  to reach a bit to keep up speed.  Proposal: set the wheel to a gradual upwind turn,
  and then keep pulling in mainsheet to keep up.  Alternative reach more and wait
  for the spin stuff to be done.'
warnings: We adjusted the AWA offset from -4 degrees back to 0.0 (Tutmark adjusted
  it, seemed OK at the time, and it just does not seem right anymore.  Perhaps after
  we re-set the mast things went back?

  thoughts: I believe these are Sara's new base settings.  Did not get up to look
    at the mast.  Conditions were higher than expected, so there is a chance these
    were too loose.  We went pretty well, but were not out long enough to make any

description: Creative and Jubilee and us made for a good race
learnings: 'Main sheet got tangled on the binacle so rounding at Meadow Point was
  messed up.  I over focused on untangling and accidentally jibed.  Then had to jibe
  back quick to the starboard tack with More Ufda right behind.  Later Paul accused
  me of almost killing him.  That was later retracted but I was initially very anxious
  that it was closer than I realized.  He exaggeratied the danger that he was watching
  for and ducked.   He was skipper and flipped driver and bow several times when he
  felt he could do a better job in my position than I was.  I left not wanting to
  return.  Some discussion ensued over video replay. '

  need to review the video with the tack line of the spinnaker way out.  We forgot
  to pull in the tack to the mark. Our prep was rushed.  There was some discussion
  who was going to the wheel but in the end I dove back and I believe stopped a breach

  great. Jibes were flawless.  Raise was great.  Douse worked well.  Folks did their

  \ Props to Amy for working the PIT, which has dozens of little steps (in addition
  to main\u2026 and we were pretty fast).   Thanks to you both for showing up early

description: "Wow!  What a night!!!   Thanks so much to everyone for coming out and/or
  supporting this Moonlight Sail/Race.    I can't believe how nicely the wind cooperated!
  \ Here is a recap.    Whisper, Gusto, Underdog, Poke, Creative and Peer got out
  there for some fun in the dark.   \n\nThe Sunset Race started promptly at 7:43pm
  going south NBMN rounding to stbd since the wind shift came in just in time.  Whisper
  and Gusto might have still been having fun rafted up at the start, but Peer and
  Underdog engaged in a serious race to the Ballard Sails buoy.  It was pretty hard
  to see by then and I mistook a kayak for a mark and called a tack too early.  Underdog
  took the mark first and we were playing catch up on the downwind leg.  Thanks to
  Jeane Goussev's awesome spin trimming, we crept up and passed Underdog somewhere
  around N, but when the wind shifted/reversed/played dead, we fouled the spinnaker
  and failed to save it in time so Underdog left us totally in the dust!  They were
  finishing as we rounded M.  So, huge Congrats to Lek, LA, and ?? (who your the third?)
  on Underdog for the win!  \n\nThe Moonlight Sail started promptly at 9:08pm at moonrise.
  \ I tried to jump the gun since I was so excited to get going, but thx to wiser
  people we respected the real moonrise time!  The wind incredibly picked up to good
  moderate breeze 10-14knots after an early prediction of <4.  From left to right
  Poke, Creative, Peer and Underdog hit the Rock-N start line.    Creative rounded
  W just a bit out in front, and we found it hard to catch up with them but we tangled
  back and forth with Poke depending on who managed the 1.5knot current going northwest
  along the Magnolia bluffs better.   Port tack felt much better for sailing, but
  starboard was nice in the night since it really was hard to see the other boats
  at times.  As expected, the huge moon over downtown was a sight to see!  Such a
  clear beautiful night!  The ferries didn't really get in our way too much so it
  was easy sailing to D.    Now, which way were we rounding the D mark????  I won't
  say much here, but we rounded to strb with a bit of extra speed to make it around
  the big mark, had our spin set for a starboard raise and got into a good grove with
  10-12 knots coming from about 173 degrees.  We were able to stay on that gybe all
  the way to W.  We crept up on Creative downwind, but darn they are hard to catch.
  \ At some point we had lost track of both Underdog and Poke in the dark.  We were
  searching the sky and water for their little lights, but they might have been on
  the other side of a big ship parked in Elliot Bay.   Assuming it was just Creative
  we had to catch, we stayed focused on downwind speed running a bit hotter than polars
  directly to W.  Oh,  and let me point out that I did repeated tell my team that
  \"this is a Sail not a Race\", but they prompted told me that there were boats out
  there so they were racing.  There is just no way to shut off that instinct, so I
  finally put the popcorn away and got busier on main trim.  Well, out of the dark
  bluffs just shy of W, here comes Poke riding a 1.5+ knot current river along the
  coast.  They had sailed really deep on their symmetric spinnaker to take advantage
  of the current we all knew was there!  Smart sailing Elishia and Alex! They snuck
  in front of us, but didn't quite pass Creative and we ended up side by side back
  in the original left to right order Poke, Creative, Peer after the one and only
  gybe of the race all charging through the dark as the wind started picking up to
  a fresh breeze.   We stayed a bit high and were happy to have the right side since
  we like running that hot angle and we know some of that breeze was going to come
  around Magnolia Bluff.   Alas, the wind shift was still tough to handle, and I believe
  all 3 boats ended up with rudder out of water, on our ear, but under control!  Thanks,
  Amy Deckelbaum, for blowing the vang for us!!  Finally, there was the issue of finding
  the unlighted N buoy in the dark.  Harder than I expected!   Creative crossed the
  finish line first and I think we are going to have to check RaceQ's to see who gets
  the second place sticker that was promised.  Poke and Peer were right behind them!
  \  Congrats to Creative!   \n\nCongrats to all sailors out there for this epic summer
  adventure!  I really hope we can do it again sometime!  Send pics if you have some.
  \ I'm attaching mine below.  I uploaded our track to RaceQ's and Underdog and Creative
  are there, but we are labeled as Unknown for now.  My track went past midnight so
  it's a bit screwed up.  Paul is working on fixing it!  Thx, Paul, you are an awesome
  sailing partner!  \n\nSailing fast on the warm southern breeze,\nSara"
conditions: Night time and twilght sailing.   Consistent breeze up wind, oscillating
  168-195. Downwind we saw the usual massive wind shift that we see with strong breeze
  after rounding West Point and getting over toward the ship canal entrance.  It turns
  a southerly into an easterly so we are suddenly broaching.   So, stay high after
  rounding and leave yourself some room to go down as needed.  Maybe even aim high
  of the green can E, but no lower.
performance: Great!   Creative beat us upwind, but we beat Poke.  We caught Creative
  and Poke caught us so we all ended up together at the finish in dark with an invisible
  Hamberger buoy.

description: 'Start to N around Blakey Rocks to finish. Beautiful day.  Wind from
  North 335-38 more persistent than oscillation.  '
conditions: 'Mix of sun and storm clouds.  Sea state not too bad considering wind
  over 10 most of the time.  Lots of boats out so both rounding were a bit complex '
performance: "Pretty well both up wind and down wind promising.  I messed up the start
  and didn\u2019t get in position.  Too many doing same port approach   Then I messed
  up ducking Jubi down wind near Blakey Rocks and we got discombobulated.   Took the
  left on the way back when everyone else went right and caught back up.  Good boat
  speed when not messing up"
learnings: "I was uncomfortable gybing toward Jubi but said nothing.  I thought I
  could cross behind but then didn\u2019t feel like I could manage not to broach and
  be out of control.  So I called a late gybe.  Amy said someone saiddd no don\u2019t
  gybe so she delayed and it was messy.   "

description: Today was supposed to be to Scatchet Head and back, but wind was fluky
  so they set the course to be SKDF (start-Blakely Rocks-Duwamish Head ->finsish.
conditions: fluky wind from n/s.  We saw 1knot and 18 knots. plenty in the 12-16 range.
performance: We won! Class 5 = j105 one design start.
learnings: 'Claire was very active on main.  Gave us a speed edge. When leebowed,
  don''t give up!  Ease, down, speed up trim on, to get every little bit up.  We also
  should have cross winched intentionally.  We cross winched sort of by accident when
  Jared didn''t put it in the self taleer and so we wraped on the high side on a long
  reaching leg.   Worked well.  '

other: "The j105s were in class 5 for the Center Sound Series #2.  The weather was
  surprisingly nice given the forecast with some sun shining through the dark clouds.
  \ The wind was from the south when the course was set to SKDF, but before the start
  it shifted northeast so everyone popped their kites right away.  The fleet separated
  into groups, one going far west toward Bainbridge including Corvo, Insub, and Panic.
  \ A group stayed east including Moose Unknown, Creative, Liftoff, and Puff.  Jaded
  crossed over a earlier than the rest.  Peer Gynt stayed in the middle.   The wind
  started out promising but soon hit a convergence zone so it was a guessing game
  to determine which way the next best puff would come from.   Kites collapsed, jibs
  came out, kites when back up, until finally a fresh breeze from the north dominated
  and most approached Blakely Rocks on spinnaker.  It was a crowded rounding.  Insub
  was first to round with a good inside position, Peer, More Jubilee, Panic, Jaded
  and Corvo followed.   After passing the rocks, several j105 tacked to starboard
  to get clear air, but with so many big boats around it took a while to clear the
  traffic.   Peer crept up on Insub and was first to round D = Duwamish Head.  It
  was a fast reach from D to W for the fleet.   Peer stayed out in front until West
  Point where Insub cut through the shallows (at low tide!)  and gained ground.  The
  breeze to the right was a bit better and perhaps in hopes of some current relief,
  Insub went in toward the wall and Peer followed.  After a few tacks, Peer had to
  duck Insub on port, on the next crossing Peer was just a bit ahead and Insub leebowed.
  \ Peer fought hard to stay ahead and eventually pulled free in clear air to take
  the win on the last leg.  Insub took second place, More Jubilee got third.   Congrats
  to all for a good race!   \nPaul Viola set up RaceQs for this race with the start
  and finish line, so add you can add your track to the collection.   It's fun to
  watch the replay."
