The problem with shifting that role is that he is more reactive to situations than planning ahead. He sees 11 ft of depth and crash tacked when it wasn’t necessary to do that.  Also we fouled the second rounding because we got jib out late again.  Who calls that?  I’d much rather be early.  

So what is the strat role vs the driver vs just Sara’s role cuz she is more aware of the map while Paul is more oriented to wind?   

Also need to review the video with the tack line of the spinnaker way out.  We forgot to pull in the tack to the mark. Our prep was rushed.  There was some discussion who was going to the wheel but in the end I dove back and I believe stopped a breach by driving down hard like Jim said!  I’m rather proud I caught it.

Folks worked super hard to “knock the dust off” and do very well.  Might have actually helped to be shorthanded, since we needed 100% attention 100% of the time.


We focused intensely on Moose, a luxury since there were no other boats nearby (Rush was ahead the whole time!).  We marked them and beat them to U mark, and then separated 20+ boat lengths.  Congrats.


Tacks were great. Jibes were flawless.  Raise was great.  Douse worked well.  Folks did their jobs, with little practice and little review.  And no critical job got dropped.  Props to Amy for working the PIT, which has dozens of little steps (in addition to main… and we were pretty fast).

9/6/2020 20:12:27,2020-09-04,Sunset/Moonlight Race,"Wow!  What a night!!!   Thanks so much to everyone for coming out and/or supporting this Moonlight Sail/Race.    I can't believe how nicely the wind cooperated!  Here is a recap.    Whisper, Gusto, Underdog, Poke, Creative and Peer got out there for some fun in the dark.   

The Sunset Race started promptly at 7:43pm going south NBMN rounding to stbd since the wind shift came in just in time.  Whisper and Gusto might have still been having fun rafted up at the start, but Peer and Underdog engaged in a serious race to the Ballard Sails buoy.  It was pretty hard to see by then and I mistook a kayak for a mark and called a tack too early.  Underdog took the mark first and we were playing catch up on the downwind leg.  Thanks to Jeane Goussev's awesome spin trimming, we crept up and passed Underdog somewhere around N, but when the wind shifted/reversed/played dead, we fouled the spinnaker and failed to save it in time so Underdog left us totally in the dust!  They were finishing as we rounded M.  So, huge Congrats to Lek, LA, and ?? (who your the third?) on Underdog for the win!  

The Moonlight Sail started promptly at 9:08pm at moonrise.  I tried to jump the gun since I was so excited to get going, but thx to wiser people we respected the real moonrise time!  The wind incredibly picked up to good moderate breeze 10-14knots after an early prediction of <4.  From left to right Poke, Creative, Peer and Underdog hit the Rock-N start line.    Creative rounded W just a bit out in front, and we found it hard to catch up with them but we tangled back and forth with Poke depending on who managed the 1.5knot current going northwest along the Magnolia bluffs better.   Port tack felt much better for sailing, but starboard was nice in the night since it really was hard to see the other boats at times.  As expected, the huge moon over downtown was a sight to see!  Such a clear beautiful night!  The ferries didn't really get in our way too much so it was easy sailing to D.    Now, which way were we rounding the D mark????  I won't say much here, but we rounded to strb with a bit of extra speed to make it around the big mark, had our spin set for a starboard raise and got into a good grove with 10-12 knots coming from about 173 degrees.  We were able to stay on that gybe all the way to W.  We crept up on Creative downwind, but darn they are hard to catch.  At some point we had lost track of both Underdog and Poke in the dark.  We were searching the sky and water for their little lights, but they might have been on the other side of a big ship parked in Elliot Bay.   Assuming it was just Creative we had to catch, we stayed focused on downwind speed running a bit hotter than polars directly to W.  Oh,  and let me point out that I did repeated tell my team that ""this is a Sail not a Race"", but they prompted told me that there were boats out there so they were racing.  There is just no way to shut off that instinct, so I finally put the popcorn away and got busier on main trim.  Well, out of the dark bluffs just shy of W, here comes Poke riding a 1.5+ knot current river along the coast.  They had sailed really deep on their symmetric spinnaker to take advantage of the current we all knew was there!  Smart sailing Elishia and Alex! They snuck in front of us, but didn't quite pass Creative and we ended up side by side back in the original left to right order Poke, Creative, Peer after the one and only gybe of the race all charging through the dark as the wind started picking up to a fresh breeze.   We stayed a bit high and were happy to have the right side since we like running that hot angle and we know some of that breeze was going to come around Magnolia Bluff.   Alas, the wind shift was still tough to handle, and I believe all 3 boats ended up with rudder out of water, on our ear, but under control!  Thanks, Amy Deckelbaum, for blowing the vang for us!!  Finally, there was the issue of finding the unlighted N buoy in the dark.  Harder than I expected!   Creative crossed the finish line first and I think we are going to have to check RaceQ's to see who gets the second place sticker that was promised.  Poke and Peer were right behind them!   Congrats to Creative!   

Congrats to all sailors out there for this epic summer adventure!  I really hope we can do it again sometime!  Send pics if you have some.  I'm attaching mine below.  I uploaded our track to RaceQ's and Underdog and Creative are there, but we are labeled as Unknown for now.  My track went past midnight so it's a bit screwed up.  Paul is working on fixing it!  Thx, Paul, you are an awesome sailing partner!
