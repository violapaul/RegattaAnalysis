    "I've found the most productive way to write and document code is by building it up in a Jupyter notebook.  I use the notebook to define the problem, the inputs and outputs, include examples, references and links, and then build up to a final set of solutions.  Along the way I end up writing functions which are similar or identical to a set functions to be collected into a module (the python name for libraries of functions).  Modules are critical because they can be imported and used in other notebooks/modules.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the notebook and the module can get out of sync.  I'll find a bug in the module as I am using it, and then go fix it.  Or I'll add a bit of functionality.  Gradually the notebook becomes stale.  Most of the info in the notebook is still true, but it doesn't reflect the final details accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be way better if the **Notebook was the Module** and the **Module was the Notebook**.  \n",

    "The code in this notebook/module provides a means to unify these concepts."

    "\n",
    "- [Knuth's Paper](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf), great but not that accessible.\n",
    "- [Literate Programming Site](http://www.literateprogramming.com/), oddly structured (what is this site trying to achieve?).\n",
    "- [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), always a good place to start.\n",
    "- [A Gentle Introduction](http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/litprog.html), one of the best I have read.\n",
    "- [Physics Based Rendering](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html), a great book which uses LP to teach and define a complete working system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"literate programming\" idea is that code is a byproduct of the thinking and teaching process.  So rather than write a program with embedded comments, you write a teaching document in Knuth's WEB language which includes the code, using markup that allows you to later tease the two pieces apart into the code (Pascal in his example) and the document (TeX).  The final code itself is not meant for anyone to read... it is only intended for the compiler.  The surprising part for me is that the code is never really presented in one piece, though it could be.  In the WEB document it is sliced and diced into pieces and only assembled at the end (more on this below).  (BTW, Knuth is brilliant and always right, but I am not a huge fan of the look and feel of the languages he developed.  WEB was never widely used, and of course \"web\" now means something entirely different. TeX, while universal and awesome, has a programming language which kind of sucks.  The algorithms in his books were written in MIX, another painful choice. Python does not suck and neither do Jupyter notebooks.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are sort of similar to \"literate programs\" containing code and documentation side by side.  As they are currently used, notebooks are both better and worse.  They are better because a notebook can include examples,  running code, and code outputs.  A Notebook is not just a dead document.  Notebooks are worse because they are typically not used to create code libraries which are reusable by other modules and other users (this is the ultimate goal of most programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "I am arguing for a **Literate Notebook**, a WYSIWYG document including running examples and results, which can be post-processed to create the module which can then be used by other python programs and notebooks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Doesn't it already work that way?  Unfortunately not.  The simplest (boring) reason is that a notebook is a JSON file and not a python module (the notebook extension is `.ipynb`).  This JSON includes markdown cells (like this one) and code cells.  At a minimum we would need to pull the code out of the ipynb file and put it into a `.py` file.  But a typical notebook also includes non-essential code: references to example data, or partially written functionality, or attempts to decompose the problem (like any textbook would).  This code is not welcome in our streamlined and efficient module (though it is super useful when understanding the module).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, jupyter notebooks already include a scheme for converting ipynb files into \"python\" (`juypyter nbconvert`).  But the conversion is hamfisted and the code not terribly reusable.  And it includes all the code, both the ephemera and the reusable functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "My proposal is quite simple (all good ideas are simple, though not all simple ideas are good): add a few tags, harmlessly included in comments, which flag cells as \"notebook only\" or \"destined for the module\".  Using some discipline in the notebook authoring process, it is possible to extract the module from the literate notebook, and they magically stay in sync forever.  The fact that the notebook is straightforward JSON helps tremendously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why doesn't everyone do this?  Honestly not sure. The missing piece is actually quite simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the extracted module, while it can stand on its own and will have embedded comments, should not be read/edited directly: *read and understand the code in the literate notebook.*  Over time it is possible folks will edit the module, disconnecting the module from the literate notebook.  At that point the literate notebook loses most of its value, and should be deleted.\n",

    "### Literate Programming is a bit different\n",
    "\n",
    "To be honest, LP can be mysterious, and WEB examples seem sort of complex. Central to WEB is a feature missing from the trivially simple Literate Notebook defined above:  *single functions can be decomposed into pieces and described independently.*  The final \"tangling\" process, takes these pieces and weaves them back together into a single syntactically valid function.  The  Pascal example from Knuth's original paper is a single tangled mess (hence the name tangle for the process of constructing the source code).  Below is the resulting Pascal (its unfair to judge this code too closely, since later tools do a much better job):\n",

I often need to run code to see what I've missed.  Corner cases.  Missing steps.  One of the greatest things about programming is that the compiler/interpreter will find your bugs by failing to do what you intended.  I am not sure how that feedback loop works with WEB. And modern IDE's find a lot of issues very early (like missing references and syntax errors). \n",
    "\n",
    "I am proposing something simpler and less powerful, but more closely associated with typical programming.  Every modern programming language allows you to break computations into pieces through the use of functions.  Each function is syntactically separate and can be described independently.  I imagine Literate Notebooks using functions to decompose and document functionality.  I also believe you can build up functionality through partial or even failed attempts.  These can all go in the notebook and provide a scheme for understanding the final set of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am pretty sure I would **not** like programming in WEB.  Expressions interact in complex ways, mostly through variable definitions that are shared in the various namespaces of the function.  It can be further complex if the syntax of the language does not simply allow you to string together subpieces.  Using LP and WEB is likely easier in a language like lisp; since the syntax is trivial, the pieces can be easily glued back together.  Its even easier in a functional subset of lisp (like [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)), because then the subpieces only interact through the values of the expressions (no side effects).  LP for Clojure might work for me. \n",
    "\n",
    "I honestly got lost as Knuth wrote a Pascal function in WEB.  It was super hard to just see the whole structure of the function, and I was worried that it would not just glue back together in a meaningful way.  I kept asking, *can't I just see the function*?\n",

    "The \"cell\" structure of Jupyter notebook's is central. Each cell is either code or markdown.  We will go further to define sub-types of code cells: notebook and module. Code cells containing the a comment `#notebook` are intended for the notebook only, and are created to explain concepts or to provide examples.  The remaining code cells are \"module cells\" and contain code destined for the module.  These are the final functions that will be used to implement the required functionality and solve the problem at hand.  \n",

    "\n",
    "If you define a function or constant in a *notebook* cell, you **cannot** use it in a *module* cell.  It will all work just fine in the literate notebook, but when the notebook cells are stripped away, the module will not have access to those symbols.  Unfortunately there is nothing about the Jupyter notebook which will prevent this.  It can lead to bugs that will only appear when the module is loaded and run. This can also lead to some duplication, where the same values are defined both in the notebook and module cells.\n",

    "\n",

Global edit/replace and refactor are marginal. Some programming is just best done in an industrial grade IDE (I use emacs with lots of python add-ins).  \n",
    "\n",
    "To support this, literate notebooks will provide a *round-trip* functionality as well.  This extracts all of the cells into a single python file which can be loaded into any editor.  This text file can then be executed, edited, or modified in flexible ways.  When you're done you convert it back to a literate notebook where it can resume its role a beautiful web enabled WYSIWYG experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do you handle references to modules\n",
    "\n",

I use the notebook to define the problem, the inputs and outputs, include examples, references and links, and then build up to a final set of solutions.  Along the way I end up writing functions which are similar or identical to a set functions to be collected into a module (the python name for libraries of functions).  Modules are critical because they can be imported and used in other notebooks/modules.  \n",

Gradually the notebook becomes stale.  Most of the info in the notebook is still true, but it doesn't reflect the final details accurately.\n",

The final code itself is not meant for anyone to read... it is only intended for the compiler.  The surprising part for me is that the code is never really presented in one piece, though it could be.  In the WEB document it is sliced and diced into pieces and only assembled at the end (more on this below).  (BTW, Knuth is brilliant and always right, but I am not a huge fan of the look and feel of the languages he developed.  WEB was never widely used, and of course \"web\" now means something entirely different. TeX, while universal and awesome, has a programming language which kind of sucks.
