  Beautiful day. Winds were 3 quickly building to 10ish. Flat
  seas. Upwind to Pt. Wells buoy, raised and raced home to the hamburger.
performance: >-
  Good height and speed vs. Creative on the way upwind. Perhaps a bit
  slow at first downwind, exploring to tradeoffs between depth and
  speed.  Best downwind speed when I was at the shrouds and Sara had a
  hand on the mainsheet.
learnings: >-
  Let the sails out for downwind: both main and kite.  Stand forward
  if possible.

  Shroud settings seemed really great, and versatile.  With only 2 on
  the boat, we sailed very well.  These settings are the new base!

      Overall we have had trouble with the Quantum quick tune card,
      where the uppers are a bit too loose or the middles too tight.
      The result is that the mast falls off at the top, rather than
      staying straight or sagging for power.  We took a bit off the
      middle (12 down to 10).

  Beautiful day. Very light at times, almost glassy.
performance: >-
  Good height and speed vs. Creative.  Generally Creative sails lower and
  faster, and it can be super hard to know who is winning.  
  
  We sailed both with 'full depth' sails (no backstay, high traveler,
  little outhaul, light halyards) and with "flat sails" (4 inches of
  backstay, outhaul, tighter halyards).  I am not sure there was a
  clear winner from looking at the video.  We sailed higher on flat
  sails, without much speed penalty.  The height is very clear near
  the end of the video.

  I do know there was a point when we were flat where we encountered
  some smallish waves from a powerboat...  we seemed to stop in our
  tracks.  And if the wind were to come up (to 6 or 8), "full sails"
  would be right.

  The only recent race where I would consider "flat" would be
  Foulweather Bluff.  Hours of flat and glassy with less than 3 knots
  of wind.  It took us a while to get in the groove on flat...  so a
  very long leg would be needed.
learnings: >-
  Based on Al's advice, we got a bit more speed and height by lowering
  traveller a bit and sheeting on more.
setting_thoughts: >-
  We were expecting a super light day, and it did not disappoint.
  Often below the 3 knots, though most of the time we had enough wind
  to move.

  Super light winds from the SSE (1-3) during tuneup.  Gave up a bit early.  After, on
  the way back, winds picked up to 8-10.

  There should have been a large have been a large current heading
  south, due to a large flood.  The interactions between southerly
  current and winds from the south may have been complex.
performance: >-
  We tried flat sails again vs. Creative and did not do well.
  Initially it seemed OK, but then they just pulled away (perhaps as
  we encountered wake from passing barge.)

      At times it seems that we can sail higher on flat sails, without losing too much speed.  But when we encounter waves, we seem to stop.

  Overcast.  Calm as we arrived on dock, but then it picked up to 10-15.  A bit rough.

  Good. Given the conditions we did not see too much weather helm, nor
  a lot of heel.  Seemed faster on stbd than port.

      Leward upper was lose at times, with about a 1 inch circle.
      Leward middle was snug.  The top fell off to leward when
      pressure was high.  Even with 4-5 backstay, there was still
      noticable sag in the headstay.

      Perhaps we could have gone a bit tigher overall.  Tighter up to
      control fall off.  Tighter middles/lower to transfer more
      tension to headstay.  But it is not clear if that would be
      faster.  The boat did not show excessive heel or weather helm.

  Once again, sailed higher (faster?) on stbd than port.
learnings: ""
observations: >-
  Way better!  We handled every transition without a major mistake.
  Need to get better at rounding upwind and trimming to accelerate.
  Don't be a afraid to reach a bit to keep up speed.  Proposal: set
  the wheel to a gradual upwind turn, and then keep pulling in
  mainsheet to keep up.  Alternative reach more and wait for the spin
  stuff to be done.
warnings: >-
  We adjusted the AWA offset from -4 degrees back to 0.0 (Tutmark
  adjusted it, seemed OK at the time, and it just does not seem right
  anymore.  Perhaps after we re-set the mast things went back?

      Good sag at light wind, down to 3-4.  Below that straight.
      Seemed to work OK up to 10, not too much helm. Note, at 10
      leeward upper had 2 inches of play.
