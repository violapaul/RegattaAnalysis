    "\n",
    "We will investigate the computation of TWA/TWD/TWS.  Naive approaches, while they work reasonably well, will not match what is computed on the boat.  \n",

    "An alternative approach has a much more complex derivation, but it matches the boat estimates near perfectly and is nevertheless fairly simple to implement.\n",

    "- AWA: apparent wind angle, the angle of the wind blowing at the top the mast (fast but noisy)\n",
    "- AWS: apparent wind speed, the speed at the mast head (fast and noisy)\n",
    "- SPD: boat speed **through the water** measured with the paddle wheel speedo in the hull (fast and noisy)\n",
    "- HDG: compass heading (on PG this is magnetic northa and not true north, though easily corrected using magnetic variation/declination).\n",
    "- COG and SOG: course and speed over ground from the GPS (these are relative to true north not magnetic on PG). These can differ from HDG/SPD because of current and leeway.\n",

    "### Computed Quantities\n",
    "- TWS: true wind speed, the speed of the wind over the ground (computed from the above quantities using the \"wind triangle\").\n",
    "- TWD: true wind direction, the angle of the wind blowing over the ground (see \"wind triangle\").\n",

    "\n",
    "Apparent wind conflates the \"true wind\" and boat movement.  If the boat were stationary (e.g. at the dock) the apparent wind and the true wind are the same (both in speed and direction).  But if the boat is moving it induces apparent \"wind\" which is equal and opposite to the boat's speed and direction (when you stick your hand out the window of your car on the highway you observe the car's apparent wind).  **True Wind** is an attempt to subtract the boat's motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, AWA, AWS, and SPD are directly measured by sensor units on the boat.  True wind must be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "True wind is valuable in part because it is more consistent and drives the strategy that you use on the race course.  Note TWA is reported relative to the boat, and TWD is reported relative to true north. We will see that they are otherwise the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute the TWA from AWA/AWS/SPD using the code below.  It is basic vector addition (and trigonometry).\n",
    "\n",
    "My preferred way to do this is to separate the two components of the apparent wind: i) the wind along the boat (which I think of as \"boat north\" pointing to the BOW) and ii) the wind perpedicular to the boat, \"boat east\" or PORT.  The SPD is then subtracted from boat north (since the boat is assumed to be moving forward in the \"boat north\" coordinates, though there may be [Leeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeway) or current). All of this can be transformed into global north by adding the boats heading (which we will not do here).  Note, heading (HDG) is reported in magnetic coordinates, not true north, so be careful to add in the magnetic variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on sailing instruments the book *Sail Smart: Understand Your Instruments to Sail Faster, Make the Right Calls & Win Races* by Mark Chisnell provides quite a bit of helpful info on boat instruments and measurements. [link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F3CKRLH/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_Px-gEbZJ52RTX).  The book is short, and for some it will repeat a lot of the basics, but it is helpful none the less."

    "\n",
    "The simple scheme for relating apparent wind (AW) and true wind (TW) assumes that the motion of the boat is simple: the boat moves in the direction of HDG at SPD.  There are two other sources of motion which could violate this assumption: current and leeway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current is the flow of water most often related to tides (particularly in the Puget Sound).  The true motion of the boat is the **sum** of the boat's sailing vector and the current vector.  It is not impossible to be sailing in light winds, and actually find you are moving backward.  Often current tables are available that can be use to predict current (and many experienced sailors have excellent memories based on past racing).\n",
    "\n",
    "While current is an external phenomena unrelated to the boat, **leeway** is the tendency of boat to slip to leeward as it sails upwind. Naively, one might imagine that the boat sails in the direction it is pointed.  In practice the boat is likely slipping 2-10 degrees lower than the HDG, and this is called leeway.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the apparent wind passes over the sail, the lift/force generated can be decomposed into two components: one in the direction of boat travel (drive), and a second perpendicular to travel (heel).  The drive force keeps the boat moving; the heel pushes sideways and causes heel (no surprise) and also a drift to leeward.  Upwind sailing is possible because as the boat begins to move the keel generates lift to counteract the heel force.  Since the keel is a symmetric wing, it must have a positive angle of attack (point up) to generate lift and counteract the heeling force.  In this way, the COG is alway lower than HDG, and the angle is the leeway.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I consider leeway an internal property, since it is possible to measure leeway in various conditions and use this as a boat specific correction (higher heel angles typically lead to larger leeway angles).\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are really two intuitions:\n",
    "- Since the sail lift has a component to leeward there must be some drift to leeward.\n",
    "- Since the keel must counteract the leeward force, it must point slightly higher than the COG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both current and leeway cause the boat to move differently than predicted by the simple \"speed times heading\" model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively,  if the boat is slipping to leeward (which is away from the wind) then the measured AWA would be decreased.  So for a given AWA the estimated TWS should be a bit larger with leeway.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to correct for these motions?\n",

    "\n",
    "A quick aside.  As we learned in the notebook on [Instrument Delays](Instrument_Delays.ipynb), COG/SOG are delays with respect to other signals on the boat.  We can address this delay by \"looking ahead\" to used later measurements when computing.  Since we have all the data together from the log, this is easy (just use later entries in the log).  This can be done online as well (while sailing) by delaying the TWD/TWS calculation.\n"

COG causes the boat to slip away from the wind; on port tack the COG is larger than HDG (the boat slips to starboard) and on starboard tack COG is smaller than HDG (the boat slips to port).
