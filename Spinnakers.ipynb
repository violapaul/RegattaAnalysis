    "We own an untagged spinnaker that is smaller than the \"class\" spinnaker (74 m2 vs 89 m2), and was produced for the previous owner as a cruising kite.  There is a question if this kite would be better on tight reaches (less than 90 apparent), rather than flying the big kite which is listed as an A2 runner and designed to sail lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "In windward/leeward racing the answer is almost certainly no.  But we often race long distances on fixed courses, which can include tight reaches for long legs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have some experience sailing this kite doublehanded (where it is easier to handle).  And less experience sailing with a full crew.  There is anecdotal evidence it is a better reacher... and certainly puts less load on the boat below 90 AWA when the wind is above 10 kts.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been consistently surprised that other boats fly their kites when reaching, perhaps down to 60 AWA (which can be done in 5-10 kts) and down to 90 in a wide range of conditions.  It is possible that the small kite will allow us to sail hotter and faster.\n",
