    "# Metadata Module\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is a literate notebook.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata)\n",
    "> Metadata is \"data that provides information about other data\". In other words, it is \"data about data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What were the conditions on a particular day?  The crew?  What sort of jib settings did we use?  The finishing position?  What were the shroud settings?  How did they perform?  \n",
    "\n",
    "I started out by writing a email for each race, trying to including learnings, conditions, results.  I moved to creating a Google doc for each race, easier to edit and update. And then I moved to creating a Jupyter notebook for each race day, easier to include data from the actual race all in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems with these approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeated work.  Each email/gdoc/notebook is a vague copy of the previous, updated with new info.  This copy/edit process is annoying.\n",
    "  - For example, one step is to grab the weather/tides, and just this step takes a while by hand.\n",
    "- The data is locked in a human readable document, not in a machine readable representation.\n",
    "  - No easy way to generate a single document (i.e. table of contents that shows all races, dates and times).\n",
    "- No way to analyze the data in one place.  Where can we look to see trends or issues that are inconsistent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Philosophically, I like metadata which can be searched and cross-referenced.  Data should be easy to edit and update and view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to store all this metadata in a single easy to edit datastructure which can then be analyzed/created/edited/rendered for various needs."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Code to process race metadata and associate with race logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently 3 sources of hand entered metadata, hopefully fewer soon:\n",
    "- A file called metadata.yaml (in YAML).  This is the final ultimate source for metadata.\n",
    "  - YAML is super powerful, allowing you to enter complex structured info.\n",
    "  - It is also designed to be human readable (unlike a database file, or even a CSV).\n",
    "  - There is no strong schema, and its a bit disorganized.\n",
    "- A google spreadsheet (gsheet) that is fed by a [Google Form](https://forms.gle/JENZZdSWKNuoF8icA) (which is easy to use on the ride home from the race).\n",
    "  - The form determines the schema, which can be changed, but it does enforce some structure.\n",
    "  - The spreadsheet can be downloaded as a CSV from a URL.\n",
    "- An older pandas dataframe, `log_info.pd` which is should be deprecated.\n",
    "\n",
    "And a final source, which is a default and empty metadata record generated when we first upload the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases above the **key** is the date (and we therefore assume that there is a single \"file\" per day).  In practice we may have several races on a single day, though these will be in one file. The YAML file will support the ability to discuss the segments.  The Google form does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to merge duplicates?**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple rows with same date in the gsheet.\n",
    "  - Delete by hand?  Take the latest?\n",
    "- Same date in gsheet and YAML.\n",
    "  - Note, gsheet row will move to YAML when it first appears.\n",
    "  - Figure out which is newer.  \n",
    "    - If YAML is newer, keep it.\n",
    "    - If gsheet is newer, then keep **both**.  Warn user and ask to edit.\n",
