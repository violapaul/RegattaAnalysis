    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook investigates the \"central\" boat instruments are filtered/smoothed/damped to provide useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw instruments are measured with sensors that are quite noisy.\n",
    "- Various techniques for filtering this noise to remove it.\n",
    "   - The best approach appears to be a non-linear exponential filter.\n",
    "- Additionally direct processing of angle data (like AWA) is tricky, we provide a technique which works better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instruments and their Measurements\n",
    "- AWA: apparent wind angle, the angle of the wind blowing at the top the mast (fast but noisy)\n",
    "- AWS: apparent wind speed, the speed at the mast head (fast and noisy)\n",
    "- SPD: boat speed **through the water** measured with the paddle wheel speedo in the hull (fast and noisy)\n",
    "- HDG: compass heading (on PG this is magnetic northa and not true north, though easily corrected using magnetic variation/declination).\n",
    "- COG and SOG: course and speed over ground from the GPS (these are relative to true north not magnetic on PG). These can differ from HDG/SPD because of current and leeway.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computed Quantities\n",
    "- TWS: true wind speed, the speed of the wind over the ground (computed from the above quantities using the \"wind triangle\").\n",
    "- TWD: true wind direction, the angle of the wind blowing over the ground.\n",
    "- TWA: true wind angle, the angle of the wind over the ground *reported relative the orientation of the boat*."

The top of the mast is a great place, because it is up above most of the airflow which can be disturbed by the sails.  The height of the masthead helps the sensor to be in the \"freestream,\" away from the boundary layer which is close the surface.   Frequently the masthead will show more wind at a wider apparent angle than what is felt at the surface (this is called twist).\n",

    "\n",
    "Observe that apparent wind angle (AWA) appears \"noisy\".  Other raw instruments such as AWS, as well as boat speed (SPD), are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise is pure randomness, there is no structure and no clear physical explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in the above signal there is clear evidence of rapid oscillation.  Most likely this is **not** noise.  Remember that the wind sensor is at the top of the mast, 50 feet above the water, where small changes in boat heel can lead to large and rapid movement side to side.  As the boat cuts through rhythmic waves, it is plausible that regular oscilation in **measured** wind angle would result.\n",
    "\n",
    "But is this variation useful information?  Probably not.  Neither the boat, nor the wind, is rotating 9 degrees in 0.5 seconds.  So these variations might as well be noise, and we are better of \"filtering\" them away.\n",
    "\n",
    "The true AWA is hidden in this noise; if you were to display the raw wind sensor readings the numbers would be jumping around like crazy, almost impossible to read.  (On many boats you can adjust display settings to display the raw instrument readings directly.  It is not very useful.)\n",
    "\n",
    "On our B&G boat, these issues are addressed by \"damping\", which is left a bit mysterious in the Triton and Zeus B&G documentation.  Damping is a number from 0 to 10, with higher numbers providing more smoothing and less noise, while also introducing significant delay.  Further information on signal processing is provided in the documentation for some of the more advanced B&G sail computers: H5000 and WTP3.  Most likely the onboard units are using exponential filtering, perhaps a non-linear version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that what is logged for AWA is not what is shown on the instrument display (Triton and Zeus), because the mast head sensor unit broadcasts raw AWA, while the displays present a filtered/damped version, which is not logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Peer Gynt, TWA (and TWS and TWD) are computed and broadcast by the autopilot computer (if the autopilot is on, otherwise TWA/TWD are missing).  These signals are damped **before** they are sent to other devices, including our logging device.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since TWA is closely related to AWA, let's plot them both to get a sense of how damping works."

Order is related to complexity of the filter and its delay, and we'll just assume 5.  Cutoff is the frequency above which the filter rejects noise.  The Butterworth attempts to pass signal below CUTOFF and reject signal above CUTOFF.  \n",

This **cannot** be used in real-time while you are sailing, since the entire signal must be available before processing (non-causal analysis is done afterward).  My main motivation in this analysis is to understand what the boat does, and to create algorithms that might be used on the boat.\n",

    "\n",
    "After digging through various writings on boat instrument processing I discovered an offhand comment regarding non-linear filtering.  The basic idea is to implement a non-linear version of an exponential filter.  The exponential filter is perhaps the simplest smoothing filter, which can be implemented with very little processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ o_{t} = \\alpha o_{t-1} + (1 - \\alpha) i_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $o_t$ is the output and $i_t$ is the input.  Larger values of $\\alpha$ (up to 1.0) yield more smoothing (and more delay).  Smaller values of $\\alpha$ yield more noise, and less delay.  If $\\alpha = 0$ then $o_t = i_t$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the exponential filter is linear and is a close cousin of the Butterworth.  It could be called a Butterworth of order 1 (which does not seem to exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "An exponential filter is very easy to implement, even on a tiny old computer.  But it is also primitive, providing poor filtering of noise.  If you want smoother filtering, then the smoothed signal is delayed (perhaps worse than a Butterworth).  \n",

    "All filters are trying to remove the noise from the true underlying signal. When sailing, a good model for true AWA (or true TWA or HDG) is that the true signal usually changes slowly (between tacks and gybes), except when there are large step changes (at tacks/gybes).  So AWA/AWS/HDG and other signals look a bit like a classic [square wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave).\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an exponential filter which had advanced knowledge of each tack. This magic filter could use two values of alpha, say 0.99 between the tacks (to smooth out the noise) and 0.5 during the tacks (to track the large changes).  The non-linear exponential filter adjusts alpha by looking at the output of the filter.  If the tracking is poor, then the signal must be in the step regime, so alpha is reduced.  If tracking is good then alpha is increased.\n",

    "\n",
    "When racing, most of the time we sail to a constant \"target\" AWA (for max VMG).  As a result we will see the \"square wave\" we mentioned above: constant AWA with periodic large jumps. There will be natural variations, but notice in both above graphs when AWS is below 3 m/s (6 knots) the noise is measurably larger (perhaps double).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, in the first graph look at `[72000, 80000]`.  The \"noise\" in AWA is massive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general when sailing downwind the AWS is lower (since we are sailing away from the wind), this consistently increases noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "But also recall that we needed to select a `max_error` threshold, and that this threshold is basically equal to the noise we expect to see.  In the new datasets above I've found that 12 works best for first (low wind) and 6 for the second (higher wind).  Unfortunately wind can change throughout the race.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we need a threshold that is either too large (so it works all the time) or one that is adjusted based on AWS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is a too large threshold bad?  It will introduce too much delay in tacks.  Why is a too small threshold bad? It will treat noise as signal and let more noise through.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to avoid angular smoothing altogether.  Rather than process AWA and AWS separately, they can be combined into an estimate of two components of wind speed (no angles!): \"boat north\" which blows acorss the bow, and \"boat east\" which plows to port.  These components can be easily recombined to form AWS and AWA.\n"
