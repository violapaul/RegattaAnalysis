# 
# ### Crew 
# 
# Peer Gynt: Sara and Paul.  Creative: Al and Shauna
# 
# ## Summary
# 
# Quick upwind race from West Point to Meadow Point.  I know I was a bit confused about the start...  but Creative was clearly the better boat, consistently picking up boat lengths on every leg.  Nice job folks.
# 
# ## Settings
# 
# Generally we were going for depowered settings, don't know if we overdid it.  With waves perhaps we needed to go for more power?
# 
# - Shroud settings for 14-18 (base is 10-14).  Sara did the mast sighting before the "race".   
#   - While we were out she reported some fall of at the mast head (rather than sag in the middle).  We did not adjust.
#   - Afterward Sara mentioned a difference from PORT to STBD.  *More details?*
# - Jib cars at base (3 for us... but its a just a spot on the rail).
# - Backstay on (between 3 and 4 inches).  Alot for us (but not max).
# - Outhaul on hard (*red to red?*)
# - Main halyard at 10 (near max). Plus 6-9 inches of cunningham. 
#   - This is close to max for us.  We need more when the ba
# - Jib halyard at 9-10 (near max for us).
# - Main: Most of the time top telltale streaming.
# - Jib: Inside the shrouds.  Between 2-3 tapes red/green (counting from outside in).
# 
# 
# ## Observations
# 
# - Paul drove a bit more than half the time.  Sara's been driving lately and doing better.
#   - Paul likes to try to play the main (while driving),  but that is near impossible in those conditions.
# - Generally a lot of heel, but not too much weather helm.
#   - The depowered settings were meant to improve this, but perhpas we did too much?
#   - Did we need more power to punch through waves?
# - We generally did not sail higher than Creative.  
# 
# 
# ## Conditions
# 
# Sunny warm (50+).  Wind 10-15 (mostly 13ish).  Sea state 2-4 ft (big ebb tide combined with winds form the North).
