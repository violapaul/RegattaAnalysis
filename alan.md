# Collaboration with Alan

## 2020-07-26

Getting started.

Offered to pay Alan minimum wage (whatever that is) for being my productivity buddy.

Steps:

- Install Python
  - Install my variant, including pyenv, miniconda, and various packages
- Figure out github (minimal)
- Get the latest code
- Demonstrate that he can run it
