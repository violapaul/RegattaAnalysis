    "# Metadata Module\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is a literate notebook.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata)\n",
    "> Metadata is \"data that provides information about other data\". In other words, it is \"data about data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What were the conditions on a particular day?  The crew?  What sort of jib settings did we use?  The finishing position?  What were the shroud settings?  How did they perform?  \n",
    "\n",
    "I started out by writing a email for each race, trying to including learnings, conditions, results.  I moved to creating a Google doc for each race, easier to edit and update. And then I moved to creating a Jupyter notebook for each race day, easier to include data from the actual race all in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems with these approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeated work.  Each email/gdoc/notebook is a vague copy of the previous, updated with new info.  This copy/edit process is annoying.\n",
    "  - For example, one step is to grab the weather/tides, and just this step takes a while by hand.\n",
    "- The data is locked in a human readable document, not in a machine readable representation.\n",
    "  - No easy way to generate a single document (i.e. table of contents that shows all races, dates and times).\n",
    "- No way to analyze the data in one place.  Where can we look to see trends or issues that are inconsistent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Philosophically, I like metadata which can be searched and cross-referenced.  Data should be easy to edit and update and view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to store all this metadata in a single easy to edit datastructure which can then be analyzed/created/edited/rendered for various needs."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Code to process race metadata and associate with race logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently 3 sources of hand entered metadata, hopefully fewer soon:\n",
    "- A file called metadata.yaml (in YAML).  This is the final ultimate source for metadata.\n",
    "  - YAML is super powerful, allowing you to enter complex structured info.\n",
    "  - It is also designed to be human readable (unlike a database file, or even a CSV).\n",
    "  - Unfortunately there is no strong schema, and it is not that hard to mess things up.\n",
    "- A google spreadsheet (gsheet) that is fed by a [Google Form](https://forms.gle/JENZZdSWKNuoF8icA) (which is easy to use on the ride home from the race).\n",
    "  - The form determines the schema, which can be changed, but it does enforce some structure.\n",
    "  - The spreadsheet can be downloaded as a CSV from a URL.\n",
    "- An older pandas dataframe, `log_info.pd` which is now deprecated.\n",
    "\n",
    "And a final source, which is a default and empty metadata record generated when we first upload the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases above the **key** is the date (and we therefore assume that there is a single \"file\" per day).  In practice we may have several races on a single day, though these will be in one file. The YAML file will support the ability to discuss the segments.  The Google form does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to merge duplicates?**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple rows with same date in the gsheet.\n",
    "  - Delete by hand?  Take the latest?\n",
    "- Same date in gsheet and YAML.\n",
    "  - Note, gsheet row will move to YAML when it first appears.\n",
    "  - Figure out which is newer.  \n",
    "    - If YAML is newer, keep it.\n",
    "    - If gsheet is newer, then keep **both**.  Warn user and ask to edit.\n",
    "\n",

Here is a recap.    Whisper, Gusto, Underdog, Poke, Creative and Peer got out there for some fun in the dark.   \n",
       "\n",
       "The Sunset Race started promptly at 7:43pm going south NBMN rounding to stbd since the wind shift came in just in time.  Whisper and Gusto might have still been having fun rafted up at the start, but Peer and Underdog engaged in a serious race to the Ballard Sails buoy.  It was pretty hard to see by then and I mistook a kayak for a mark and called a tack too early.  Underdog took the mark first and we were playing catch up on the downwind leg.  Thanks to Jeane Goussev's awesome spin trimming, we crept up and passed Underdog somewhere around N, but when the wind shifted/reversed/played dead, we fouled the spinnaker and failed to save it in time so Underdog left us totally in the dust!  They were finishing as we rounded M.  So, huge Congrats to Lek, LA, and ?? (who your the third?) on Underdog for the win!  \n",
       "\n",
       "The Moonlight Sail started promptly at 9:08pm at moonrise.  I tried to jump the gun since I was so excited to get going, but thx to wiser people we respected the real moonrise time!  The wind incredibly picked up to good moderate breeze 10-14knots after an early prediction of <4.  From left to right Poke, Creative, Peer and Underdog hit the Rock-N start line.    Creative rounded W just a bit out in front, and we found it hard to catch up with them but we tangled back and forth with Poke depending on who managed the 1.5knot current going northwest along the Magnolia bluffs better.   Port tack felt much better for sailing, but starboard was nice in the night since it really was hard to see the other boats at times.  As expected, the huge moon over downtown was a sight to see!  Such a clear beautiful night!  The ferries didn't really get in our way too much so it was easy sailing to D.    Now, which way were we rounding the D mark????  I won't say much here, but we rounded to strb with a bit of extra speed to make it around the big mark, had our spin set for a starboard raise and got into a good grove with 10-12 knots coming from about 173 degrees.  We were able to stay on that gybe all the way to W.  We crept up on Creative downwind, but darn they are hard to catch.  At some point we had lost track of both Underdog and Poke in the dark.  We were searching the sky and water for their little lights, but they might have been on the other side of a big ship parked in Elliot Bay.   Assuming it was just Creative we had to catch, we stayed focused on downwind speed running a bit hotter than polars directly to W.  Oh,  and let me point out that I did repeated tell my team that \"this is a Sail not a Race\", but they prompted told me that there were boats out there so they were racing.  There is just no way to shut off that instinct, so I finally put the popcorn away and got busier on main trim.  Well, out of the dark bluffs just shy of W, here comes Poke riding a 1.5+ knot current river along the coast.  They had sailed really deep on their symmetric spinnaker to take advantage of the current we all knew was there!  Smart sailing Elishia and Alex! They snuck in front of us, but didn't quite pass Creative and we ended up side by side back in the original left to right order Poke, Creative, Peer after the one and only gybe of the race all charging through the dark as the wind started picking up to a fresh breeze.   We stayed a bit high and were happy to have the right side since we like running that hot angle and we know some of that breeze was going to come around Magnolia Bluff.   Alas, the wind shift was still tough to handle, and I believe all 3 boats ended up with rudder out of water, on our ear, but under control!  Thanks, Amy Deckelbaum, for blowing the vang for us!!  Finally, there was the issue of finding the unlighted N buoy in the dark.  Harder than I expected!   Creative crossed the finish line first and I think we are going to have to check RaceQ's to see who gets the second place sticker that was promised.  Poke and Peer were right behind them!   Congrats to Creative!   \n",
