title: Tune-up with Creative
description: null
begin: 27053
end: 99221
crew:
- Paul
- Sara
purpose: tune_up
conditions: Beautiful day. Winds were 3 quickly building to 10ish. Flat seas. Upwind
  to Pt. Wells buoy, raised and raced home to the hamburger.
performance: Good height and speed vs. Creative on the way upwind. Perhaps a bit slow
  at first downwind, exploring to tradeoffs between depth and speed.  Best downwind
  speed when I was at the shrouds and Sara had a hand on the mainsheet.
learnings: 'Let the sails out for downwind: both main and kite.  Stand forward if
  possible.

  Shroud settings seemed really great, and versatile.  With only 2 on the boat, we
  sailed very well.  These settings are the new base!'

  thoughts: Overall we have had trouble with the Quantum quick tune card, where the
    uppers are a bit too loose or the middles too tight. The result is that the mast
    falls off at the top, rather than staying straight or sagging for power.  We took
    a bit off the middle (12 down to 10).

purpose: tune_up
conditions: Beautiful day. Very light at times, almost glassy.
performance: 'We were expecting a super light day, and it did not disappoint. Often
  below the 3 knots, though most of the time we had enough wind to move.

  Good height and speed vs. Creative.  Generally Creative sails lower and faster,
  and it can be super hard to know who is winning.

  We sailed both with "full depth" sails (no backstay, high traveler, little outhaul,
  light halyards) and with "flat sails" (4 inches of backstay, outhaul, tighter halyards).  I
  am not sure there was a clear winner from looking at the video.  We sailed higher
  on flat sails, without much speed penalty.  The height is very clear near the end
  of the video.

  I do know there was a point when we were flat where we encountered some smallish
  waves from a powerboat...  we seemed to stop in our tracks.  And if the wind were
  to come up (to 6 or 8), "full sails" would be right.

  The only recent race where I would consider "flat" would be Foulweather Bluff.  Hours
  of flat and glassy with less than 3 knots of wind.  It took us a while to get in
  the groove on flat...  so a very long leg would be needed.'
learnings: Based on Al's advice, we got a bit more speed and height by lowering traveller
  a bit and sheeting on more.

purpose: tune_up
conditions: 'Super light winds from the SSE (1-3) during tuneup.  Gave up a bit early.  After,
  on the way back, winds picked up to 8-10.

  There should have been a strong current heading south, due to a large flood.  The
  interactions between southerly current and winds from the south may have been complex.'
performance: We tried flat sails again vs. Creative and did not do well. Initially
  it seemed OK, but then they just pulled away (perhaps as we encountered wake from
  passing barge.)

conditions: Overcast.  Calm as we arrived on dock, but then it picked up to 10-15.  A
  bit rough.
performance: Good. Given the conditions we did not see too much weather helm, nor
  a lot of heel.  Seemed faster on stbd than port.

  thoughts: 'Leward upper was lose at times, with about a 1 inch circle. Leward middle
    was snug.  The top fell off to leward when pressure was high.  Even with 4-5 backstay,
    there was still noticable sag in the headstay.

    Perhaps we could have gone a bit tigher overall.  Tighter up to control fall off.  Tighter
    middles/lower to transfer more tension to headstay.  But it is not clear if that
    would be faster.  The boat did not show excessive heel or weather helm.'

purpose: practice
crew:

conditions: Light winds and then building.
performance: Once again, sailed higher (faster?) on stbd than port.
observations: 'Way better!  We handled every transition without a major mistake. Need
  to get better at rounding upwind and trimming to accelerate. Don''t be a afraid
  to reach a bit to keep up speed.  Proposal: set the wheel to a gradual upwind turn,
  and then keep pulling in mainsheet to keep up.  Alternative reach more and wait
  for the spin stuff to be done.'
warnings: We adjusted the AWA offset from -4 degrees back to 0.0 (Tutmark adjusted
  it, seemed OK at the time, and it just does not seem right anymore.  Perhaps after
  we re-set the mast things went back?

  name: super light
  thoughts: Good sag at light wind, down to 3-4.  Below that straight. Seemed to work
    OK up to 10, not too much helm. Note, at 10 leeward upper had 2 inches of play.

  thoughts: I believe these are Sara's new base settings.  Did not get up to look
    at the mast.  Conditions were higher than expected, so there is a chance these
    were too loose.  We went pretty well, but were not out long enough to make any
    real conclusions.
